\begin{center}
I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to my advisors, Professors Susan Carey, Kathryn Davidson, and Masoud Jasbi, for their essential intellectual advice and unending support. I would also like to thank the Harvard Lab for Developmental Studies for allowing me to use their database and facilities to develop and run my study. Additional thanks to Dr. Nancy Soja for her help improving my writing and structuring my argument, to Josh Martin for his invaluable writing advice, and to my mother, Dr. Mira Hinman, for her many hours spent proofreading and listening to me work out my thoughts.
